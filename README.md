# EDA Project - AMCAT Data Analysis

This project conducts a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the AMCAT dataset, focusing on the employment outcomes of engineering graduates in India. The dataset, released by Aspiring Minds, encompasses data on approximately 4,000 candidates, featuring around 40 variables that include demographic details, academic performance, AMCAT test scores, and job outcomes, with a particular emphasis on the target variable, Salary.

## Objectives of the Project:

## Salary Analysis:

Examine the distribution of salaries offered to engineering graduates, identifying trends, outliers, and the range of compensation across different job roles.
Evaluate the correlation between various independent variables (such as academic performance and test scores) and the target variable, Salary

## Univariate Analysis:

Conduct univariate analysis on both numerical and categorical variables using visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and count plots to summarize the characteristics of each feature.
Identify and analyze outliers in the numerical columns.

## Bivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between numerical variables through scatter plots and pair plots to identify patterns and correlations.

Investigate the impact of categorical variables on salary through box plots and bar plots to understand how different specializations, degrees, and college tiers affect earning potential.
## Research Questions:

Validate claims regarding starting salaries for specific job roles, such as Programming Analyst and Software Engineer, particularly for fresh graduates.
Analyze whether there is a relationship between gender and specialization choices, exploring trends in field preferences among male and female candidates.
Insights and Recommendations:

Provide actionable insights based on the findings of the EDA, aimed at helping students, educational institutions, and employers understand the employability landscape for engineering graduates.
Highlight skills and specializations that lead to higher earning potential, guiding future educational and career choices.
This EDA project leverages a combination of statistical analysis and visualization techniques to reveal patterns and insights from the AMCAT dataset, offering a clearer understanding of the factors influencing employment outcomes in the engineering sector. The findings will be compiled into a detailed report, presenting the analysis and insights in a structured manner
